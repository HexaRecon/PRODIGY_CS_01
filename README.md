# PRODIGY_CS_01 – Caesar Cipher 🔐

This project implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python, a simple encryption technique based on letter rotation. It allows users to:
- Encrypt and decrypt messages
- Input custom shift values

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Basics of cryptography
- Character encoding and ASCII manipulation
- How to build command-line tools

## 🚀 How to Run in Terminal
```bash
& python3 caesar_cipher.py
